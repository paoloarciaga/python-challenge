To complete this Python Challenge, I met with my tutor 3 times in order to debug my code and ensure my edits worked properly. My tutor helped revise my code as I initially had a few struggles with my logic.  

My tutor was able to help me with the following:

1. Calculate the greatest decrease and increase in profits for my PyBank file 
2. Print the test results for my PyBank file 
3. Revised my code in order to create separate lines in my text file for PyBank 
4. Added the 'try' and 'error' functions in my PyPoll code in order to calculate the total number of votes cast 

Within the PyBank and PyPoll folders in this repo, you'll find the following files: 
1. The Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) where I practiced my code 
2. My final Python files (.py) with my final code 
3. The text files (.txt) which display the results of my code 

PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote
