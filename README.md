# Python-Challenge

PyBank:
Using the financial dataset budget_data.csv, I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values: 
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll Instructions:
In order to modernize this town's vote-counting process, I used the set of poll data in their election_data.csv and created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates the following values: 
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

To complete this Python Challenge, I used the tools learned from class to write my initial code. I seeked additional guidance from my tutor in order to debug my code and ensure my edits worked properly.

My tutor was able to help me with the following parts of my code:

1. Calculate the greatest decrease and increase in profits for my PyBank file 
2. Print the test results for my PyBank file 
3. Revised my code in order to create separate lines in my text file for PyBank 
4. Added the 'try' and 'error' functions in my PyPoll code in order to calculate the total number of votes cast 

Within the PyBank and PyPoll folders in this repo, you'll find the following files: 
1. The Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) where I practiced my code 
2. My final Python files (.py) with my final code 
3. The text files (.txt) which display the results of my code
