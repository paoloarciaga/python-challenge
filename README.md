To complete this Python Challenge, I met with my tutor 3 times. I used Jupyter Notebooks to ensure my code was working properly as I made progress with this challenge. My tutor helped revise my code as I initially had a few struggles with my logic.  

My tutor was able to help me with the following:

1. Calculate the greatest decrease and increase in profits for my PyBank file 
2. Print the test results for my PyBank file 
3. Revised my code in order to create separate lines in my text file for PyBank 
4. Added the 'try' and 'error' functions in my PyPoll code in order to calculate the total number of votes cast
